title: About Me

Some things about me...

Some of the technologies I'm familiar with:

- `Ansible`, for configuration management and setting up multiple computers
  easily
- Using `Nginx` as a web server and load balancer
- Python web development in either `Django` or `Flask`
- Putting the `gunicorn` WSGI server behind nginx to serve Django or Flask
  sites
- Installed Arch Linux from scratch and I use it as my day-to-day OS
- Firewalls (both with `UFW` and `iptables`)
- logging and montoring with `auditd` and `logwatch`
- Using `postfix` as a mail server
- `ssh` for both accessing a system, as well as doing advanced tunnelling and
  proxying to get around firewalls
- `fail2ban`, to stop people from trying to break into my server using brute
  force dictionary attacks
- `nmap` for basic network troubleshooting
- `metasploit` for a bit of fun and to test my security
- Static site generation with `Jekyll` or `Pelican`
- `systemd` and unit configs 
- `redis`, because it's an awesome in-memory database
- `postgres` SQL databases, plus dumping, restoring and other routine database
  maintenance
- Editing with `vim` and `emacs`
- automation and scheduling with `cron`
- Android and IOS app development with `kivy`
- Data analysis in Python with `numpy`, `pandas`, `sympy`, and `scipy`
- Managing backups with `rsync`, `backuppc` and `rsnapshot`
- Using various Amazon web services like `S3`, `EC2` and `Route52`
- Everything involved with purchasing and maintaining DNS names
- Running my personal DNS server (`dnsmasq`) to give computers on my home
  network a domain name
- Creating custom programming languages with Python and the `LLVM` bindings
- `git` and `GitHub`
- Also run my own `gitlab` server (think GitHub, but private and on your own
  hardware)

Some programming languages I know:

- Python (advanced user, also contribute to open source projects)
- C
- Rust
- C#
- JavaScript
- List
- HTML/CSS (if they can be called programming languages)
- A bit of Ruby
- Bash
- GNU Make
- Creating my own Domain Specific Languages
- LaTeX
