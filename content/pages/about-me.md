title: About Me

Some things about me...

Some of the technologies I'm familiar with:

- Using `Nginx` as a web server and load balancer
- `Ansible`, for configuration management and setting up multiple computers
    easily
- Python web development in either `Django` or `Flask`
- Arch Linux
- Firewalls (both with `UFW` and `iptables`)
- logging and montoring with `auditd` and `logwatch`
- Using `postfix` as a mail server
- `ssh` for both accessing a system, as well as doing advanced tunnelling and
    proxying to get around firewalls
- `fail2ban`, to stop people from trying to break into my server using brute
    force dictionary attacks
- `nmap` for basic network troubleshooting
- `metasploit` for a bit of fun and to test my security
- Static site generation with `Jekyll` or `Pelican`
- `systemd` and unit configs 
- `redis`, because it's an awesome in-memory database
- `postgres` SQL databases, plus dumping, restoring and other routine database
    maintenance
- Editing with `vim` and `emacs`
- automation and scheduling with `cron`

Programming languages I know:

- Python (advanced user, also contribute to open source projects)
- C
- Rust
- C#
- JavaScript
- List
- HTML/CSS (if they can be called programming languages)
- A bit of Ruby
